## Contributing to the Codebase
- Always pull from main before starting any new work `git pull origin main`
- Create a new branch for your work `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
- Never push directly to the main branch. Once your work is complete, create a pull request to merge your branch into main. Ensure that at least one team member reviews the pull request before merging
- To fetch remote changes, including newly added remote branches, run `git fetch`
